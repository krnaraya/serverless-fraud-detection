The Kogito command-line interface (CLI) enables you to interact with the Kogito Operator for deployment tasks. The Kogito CLI also enables you to deploy Kogito services from source instead of relying on custom resources and YAML files. You can use the Kogito CLI as a command-line alternative for deploying Kogito services without the OpenShift web console.

Prerequisites
The oc OpenShift CLI is installed and you are logged in to the relevant OpenShift cluster. For oc installation and login instructions, see the OpenShift documentation.

You have OpenShift permissions to create resources in a specified namespace.

Procedure
Go to the kogito-cloud-operator releases page in GitHub and download the latest version of the kogito-cli-RELEASE binary file that is specific to your operating system.

Extract the kogito-cli-RELEASE binary file to a local directory:

On Linux or Mac: In a command terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the kogito-cli-RELEASE binary file and enter the following command to extract the contents:

Extract the Kogito CLI distribution
$ tar -xvf kogito-cli-RELEASE.tar.gz
On Windows: In your file browser, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the kogito-cli-RELEASE binary file and extract the ZIP file.

The kogito executable file appears.

Move the extracted kogito file to an existing directory in your PATH variable:

On Linux or Mac: In a command terminal, enter the following command:

Move the kogito file
$ cp /PATH_TO_KOGITO /usr/local/bin
On Windows: Update the relevant PATH environment variables in your system settings to include the path to the Kogito CLI folder. For example, on Windows 10, go to Settings → System Info → Advanced System Settings → Advanced → Environment Variables and in the User or System variables, add the path for the Kogito CLI folder to the PATH variable. Close and reopen your Windows command prompt to apply the changes.

You must be logged in to the relevant OpenShift cluster using the oc login command.
